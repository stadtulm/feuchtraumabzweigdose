How to:
-------

This pcb is meant to function as an experimental playground for the open bike project. It integrates WiFi, Bluetooth and LORA and has a dedicated header for a gyro module. It exposes a shared spi bus, two serial lines and all unused pins of the ESP32, with several RTC interrupt methods available in hardware. A dedicated dynamo-to-Li+ charger as well as an efficient 3.3V LDO to supply the logic can be populated optionally.
